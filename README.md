# Indie-Game-List

This a compiled list of Indie titles seperated by genre for easy access to find and share! I hope to use this as a way to easily share games that might not have a huge following and support the work and effort these creators have put in for their game!

There will be a few different formats for this list. A downloadable Spreadsheet that you can download an open locally at any time. The public spreadsheet on Google Sheets, and the file system with Readme's for each and every game with the same information as the spreadsheet!

There will also be some games that are in developement here and don't have a playable version. While the games might not be out yet they are activly being worked on and will (Ideally) release eventually.

Also make sure to check out [AndreaJens Indie Fighting Game Ads](https://github.com/AndreaJens/indie-fighting-game-ads) repository if you plan on running any kind of events for the fighting games as a way to help spread the word in an easy to see ad.
